<h1>PUNCH,<br />

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

<h2>VOLUME 147.</h2>

<hr class="full" />

<h2>November 18, 1914.</h2>

<hr class="full" />

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>Contrary to the usual custom there were no official dinners on the eve
of the opening of Parliament. The explanation of this is clear to the
German Press. It was due to scarcity of food.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Upon receipt of the Japanese ultimatum, the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>, it may be
remembered, cabled to the commander of his Chinese fortress:&mdash;"Bear in
mind that it would shame me more to surrender Kiaochau to the Japanese
than Berlin to the Russians." The kind-hearted Russians will now, we
feel sure, have less compunction in taking Berlin, seeing that the blow
will have been softened to an anticlimax.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">Kaiser's</span> hair, it is said, is now bleached: but this attempt to look
like a white man will deceive no one.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Just as we go to press a report reaches us which certainly bears the
impress of truth on the face of it. It declares that the <span class="sc">Crown Prince</span>
has been shot for looting by a short-sighted brother-officer who did not
recognise the son of God's Vice-regent on Earth.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The British Navy is in hiding," says the <i>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</i>. We beg
our fragrant contemporary not to worry. In due course the Germans shall
have the hiding.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is so frequently stated that the leaders of the German Army attach no
importance to the lives of their men that it seems only fair to point
out that last week Brussels was fined &pound;200,000 for wounding a couple of
German policemen.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Neither the French, Russian, Belgian, nor British troops like the idea
of fighting against the mere youths whom a paternal <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> is now
sending into the firing line, and a humane suggestion has been put
forward for correcting this embarrassment. Would it not be possible, it
is asked, to arrange Boys' Own Battles, in which the German little ones
would be opposed by the young of the Allies?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Klopstock, one of our greatest geniuses," says the <i>Hamburger
Fremdenblatt</i>, "taught us, 'Be not excessively just.' We shall endeavour
now to follow that teaching." We should say that there is no great
danger of the German nation breaking down under the strain of this
effort.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"How ever do the Teutons manage to produce so many lies about us?" asks
"A Lover of Truth." Our correspondent is evidently not much of a
gardener or he would have heard of "Intensive Culture."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The reply published by the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> to the protest of French
clergymen against the destruction of Louvain and the shelling of Rheims
Cathedral contained at least one unfortunate expression. It asserted
that the <span class="sc">German Emperor</span> and the German People are both permeated with a
burning love of peace.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Rev. Mr. <span class="sc">Edwards</span> has resigned his assistant curacy at Tettenhall
under somewhat peculiar circumstances, but we are sure the case is not
so bad as <i>The Wolverhampton Express</i> would have us believe. According
to our contemporary this gentleman exhorted his congregation "not to
hate the Germans, but rather to pay for them."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A wounded Tommy in one of our London hospitals, on being asked, the
other day, by a lady visitor what he thought of the French soldiers,
replied that he very much admired the French Cura&ccedil;aos.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When in Breslau, The Evening News tells us, the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> promised that the
Russian Army should be crushed. Fortunately in this case the undertaking
was not even written on a scrap of paper.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"For thirty-two years," says the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>, "Egypt has had to
endure British rule." Curiously enough this bright little sheet does not
go on to point out that during the same period the poor Egyptians have
also had to put up with a good deal of prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="sc">"Wot's the Use of This 'ere Earlier Closing?"</span></p>

<h4>A Beauty Spot.</h4>

<blockquote><p>"This photograph of the town of Pervyse, on the road from Nieuport
to Dixmude, has been taken and retaken by both sides several times.
Our photograph was taken just after it had again come into the
possession of the Allies."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It is now the German photographer's turn again.</p>

<hr class="short" /><br />

<center>Another song for the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>:&mdash;
"<span class="sc">Come Tsing Tau Me</span>."</center><br />

<hr class="short" />

<p>Translation of a letter received by The Morning Post:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"By spring-time of the 6,000,000 German soldiers there will remain
only three capable of fighting."</p></blockquote>

<p>The <span class="sc">Crown Prince</span> and two privates.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">"Patriotism for Pauper Children.</span>&mdash;The Lambeth Guardians yesterday
decided that in order that the Poor-law school children may have an
opportunity of appreciating the position of national affairs the
usual practice of allowing each child an egg for breakfast on
Christmas morning be suspended this year."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If this doesn't learn them to love their country, it ought, at any rate,
to encourage them to honour and respect the patriotic Lambeth Guardians.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<blockquote><p>"Pending operations for her capture, or destruction, effective steps
have been taken to block the K&ouml;nigsberg in by inking colliers in the
only navigable channel."--<i>Birmingham Daily Mail.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Aren't they black enough already?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Examples of official enthusiasm are always welcome, and we therefore
give further publicity to the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Cossacks who have been mobilised in the Amur district have sent
the following telegram to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian
forces:</p>

<p>'Your children are coming to your aid, father commander. They come
shouting "Hurrah!"'</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicholas replied:</p>

<p>'I shall be very pleased to see you.'&mdash;<i>Reuter.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<h2>WHY I DON'T ENLIST.</h2>

<blockquote><p>[Curiosity is often expressed regarding the causes which have
prevented young men from enlisting. Considerable interest,
therefore, should attach to the following replies to enquiries, an
inspection of which has been permitted us by the Secretary of the
Patriotic League, an organisation which seeks to stimulate
recruiting by writing to young healthy and unmarried men and asking
them why they do not join the colours.]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I fully understand your views&mdash;in fact I am in cordial
agreement with them. It would be quite fair to say of most young
unmarried men that they could and should be spared. But this cannot be
said of all young men. There is a small section of literary and other
artists whose lives must continue to be immeasurably precious to the
nation which has given them birth. From this company it is impossible
for me to exclude myself. There is a higher patriotism, to the dictates
of which I must respond. With infinite regrets, and thanks for what is
doubtless a well-meant endeavour,</p>

<p class="regards">I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Endymion Browne.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;If you should be in town on the 24th, I am giving a reading from
my own works at the United Intensities Club&mdash;"A Night with Endymion
Browne."</p><br />

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;What you say is O.K. <span class="sc">Kitchener</span> must have men and all that
sort of thing. Show the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> who's boss, and so on. But there are some
men who <i>can't</i> possibly go. And I'm one. It's all very well to say
"Go," but <i>if</i> I go&mdash;let me ask you quite seriously&mdash;how on earth is
Smoketown Tuesday F.C. to lift the English pot? I don't want to shout
about myself, but it is a known fact that I'm positively the <i>only</i>
centre forward they've got. I'm worth &pound;200 a week to the gate alone. If
you don't care to accept my word, that it is absolutely <i>impossible</i> for
me to go, I'll refer you to what our secretary says at foot.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">Alf Booter</span>.</p>

<p><i>Note by Secretary</i>&mdash;What Booter says is quite true. He is
indispensable. We paid &pound;1,000 for his transfer, and could not possibly
sanction his leaving us. Besides, some of his many thousand admirers
might want to follow his example, and where would our gate be then?</p><br />

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;If I was to go and enlist, how could I follow the Occident
and help 'em to win the League Championship? There it is, quite
short&mdash;how? And if I didn't follow, and if others like me didn't follow,
how'd the club stick it? How'd it keep going? What price duty of staying
at home?</p>

<p class="regards">
I am, yours truly,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">Bert Socksley</span>.</p><br />

<center>[Dictated.]</center>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I snatch a moment to answer your letter, "Why don't I go to fight
the Germans?" I <i>am</i> fighting them. I cleared &pound;500 this morning which,
before the war, would have gone into a German pocket. My motto is
"Business as usual," and I have no complaints whatever against the
Germans so long as I can go on fighting them some more in my own way.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">George Crabbe</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter for my brother, John Halton, has reached me by
mistake, but I'll answer it. "Why don't I go?" Just send me a recipe for
turning me into a boy, and you'll not have to ask me twice.</p>

<p class="regards">
Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">Joan Halton</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I know what my job is, so don't you come poking your nose in
where it isn't wanted. I'm for England, I am. And I'm doing my bit. <i>The
Evening Wiper</i> said only the other day that a Britisher's duty was to
keep cheerful, and that the man who did that was serving his country.
Well, I <i>am</i> cheerful&mdash;I didn't turn a hair even over Mons&mdash;slept
exactly the same, and had bacon and tomato for my breakfast. Then they
say, "Carry on." And I do carry on. I go out as usual, dress just as
carefully&mdash;spats, fancy waistcoat, buttonhole, etc. One night it's the
Imperial and another it's the Cinema. Men are wanted to cheer the
patriotic songs and to sing the chorus of "Tipperary." I help here. Then
I spend my money freely&mdash;<i>freely</i>, I tell you. Any Tommy I meet can have
a drink&mdash;half a dozen at my expense, and no return expected. I got two
quite blind last night, and never asked 'em for a sou. Then again, I've
spent quite a lot on flags. I always wear six on the front of my bike
when I scorch through the crowds coming out of church on Sundays. I've
got portrait buttons, too, of <span class="sc">Joffre</span> and <span class="sc">Kitch</span>., and I'm never ashamed
to wear 'em. <i>And I'm always urging chaps to go and enlist.</i> So you see
I am doing my bit.</p>

<p class="regards">
Yours truly,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">Albert Spottle</span>.</p>

<h2>WITH ALL RESERVE.</h2>

<p>Departing from the time-honoured custom of believing everything they see
in print, the British people are learning in these times that one should
only run the risk of believing printed news that has passed the Censor.
By the time the war is over the new habit will have become established,
and we may look for items like the following in our daily papers:&mdash;</p>

<p>The right hon. gentleman went on to say that so long as the people of
this country permitted the present Government to remain in power, so
long would this country be governed in a manner which could never win
the approval of the Opposition.</p>

<blockquote>[The above having been passed by the Censor may be accepted as
correct.&mdash;ED.]</blockquote>

<p>The weather yesterday varied throughout the country. While in the
extreme north it was warm and sunny, in the south snow fell. A violent
hailstorm swept Battersea from end to end; yet in Stornoway the day was
marked by a sky of cloudless blue. Once more the climate of these
islands showed itself to be a fickle and unstable thing.</p>

<blockquote>[The above has been submitted to the Censor, who sees no reason why it
should be withheld from the public; and it may therefore be taken that
in the main it is moderately accurate.&mdash;ED.]</blockquote>

<p>Lady A.'s dinner-party at the Ritz Hotel last evening was not a great
success. The decorations of pink carnations were but moderately admired
by her undistinguished guests. The Blue Petrogradese Orchestra played
without particular brilliance. Among those absent without reason
assigned were the Duke and Duchess of W., the Earl and Countess X., the
Bishop of Y., and Mr. Z., the unknown poet.</p>

<blockquote>[The above has been submitted to the Censor, who possessed no official
knowledge of the facts, but considered that the report had an air of
sufficient probability.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span>]</blockquote>

<h2>AUNT LOUISA'S SONG SCENA.</h2>

<p>Just as adversity sometimes brings out men's strongest characteristics,
hitherto unsuspected, so can amateur theatricals lead to surprising
discoveries of humour and resource. Everyone must have noticed it.</p>

<p>No one had ever credited Aunt Louisa with any dramatic sense whatever.
She is so gentle and so placid. She was always something of a knitter,
and, like all essential knitters, given to sitting a little outside of
life; but since the war broke out she has knitted practically without
ceasing; and who would dream of going to a knitter for stage effects?</p>

<p>Therefore we were astonished when, in talking over the projected
Saturday night's entertainment, Aunt Louisa ventured the statement that
she had thought out a scheme for a little interlude, and might she be
permitted to carry it out? Just a mere fill up, but topical, or possibly
even more than topical&mdash;prophetic.</p>

<p>Of course she might.</p>

<p>"Is it a tableau?" our stage manager inquired.</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't call it a tableau," said Aunt Louisa; "I should call it
a song scena."</p>

<p>How on earth did she hear that phrase? She never goes to music-halls. I
would as soon expect to hear her speak of "featuring."</p>

<p>"A song scena," she went on, "the hero of which is the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>; and I
shall want half-a-dozen gentlemen to assist."</p>

<p>The busy fingers knitted away and the gold spectacles were fixed on us
with bland benignity. Aunt Louisa writing a song scena and ordering a
chorus, just like Mr. <span class="sc">George Edwardes</span>, was not the least of the miracles
produced by this war.</p>

<p>A company of six of us volunteered, of whom I was one. Another was Mr.
Herbert Foley, who has made private theatricals his life study.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do to help you in coaching the performers and so on," he
said, "I shall be only too pleased to do. You know I'm no chicken at
this sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Aunt Louisa, "but I think I can manage."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Mr. Foley, "but, of course&mdash;&mdash;. Want of
experience&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"First of all," said Aunt Louisa, "I must choose a Kaiser. Someone who
can act."</p>

<p>We all became very self-conscious. Our expressions said severally, "No
one can act as well as I, but it's rotten form to push oneself forward."</p>

<p>Aunt Louisa scanned us narrowly and, much to everybody else's surprise,
picked out Tommy Thurlow. To my mind she could not have made a worse
choice; but, as it happened, her judgment was sound.</p>

<p>Foley seemed piqued. "Then what do <i>we</i> do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You are chorus men," said she.</p>

<p>"Chorus!" said Foley.</p>

<p>"Isn't that the right word? I know so little about these things. Perhaps
I ought to have said 'supers.'"</p>

<p>She then told us what to do, knitting all the while.</p>

<p>On the evening Aunt Louisa's song scena was the success of the show. It
was called "The Haunted Kaiser," and it began with a distracted demented
Tommy Thurlow, with the familiar Potsdam moustache and an excellent wig
from London, rushing on with his fingers in his ears. No doubt as to who
it was&mdash;the <span class="sc">War Lord</span> in a state bordering on delirium. Having calmed
down a little, he began to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For years and years I'd waited,</p>
<p class="i2">Preparing for <i>The Day</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">The day that meant for Germany</p>
<p class="i2">A universal sway.</p>
<p class="i4">Alas, alack,</p>
<p class="i4">For my set back!</p>
</div></div>

<p>At this point a number of tea-trays were smitten resonantly "off." Tommy
dramatically heard them and sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">What's that that smites upon my ear,</p>
<p class="i0">The sound of cruel guns I hear,</p>
<p class="i2">That sound of fear?</p>
</div></div>

<p>More tea-tray.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The British, French and Russians</p>
<p class="i0">They are murdering my Prussians:</p>
<p class="i2">Why did I make this war?</p>
<p class="i0">They're in my way by day, by night:</p>
<p class="i2">In vain, in vain I take to flight,</p>
<p class="i4">I'll hear them evermore&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">Those guns! Those guns!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Tremendous applause, while Tommy prepared for the second verse and Aunt
Louisa's great effect.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Alas! for my ambition,</p>
<p class="i2">My glory passed away!</p>
<p class="i0">What is there left of Germany</p>
<p class="i2">But misery to-day?</p>
<p class="i4">Alack, alas,</p>
<p class="i4">For such a pass!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here on several concertinas in different parts of the hall, as well as
upstairs, was heard, "It's a long way to Tipperary." Tommy began to
behave like a maniac. He rushed about more wildly than before. He
stopped his ears. He tried to hide. Then he began to sing again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">What's that that bursts upon my ear,</p>
<p class="i0">That overwhelming song I hear,</p>
<p class="i2">That sound of fear?</p>
<p class="i0">Though brave my men and wary,</p>
<p class="i0">They've been done by "Tipperary;"</p>
<p class="i2">Why did I make this war?</p>
<p class="i0">It's in my brain by day, by night,</p>
<p class="i0">In vain, in vain I take to flight,</p>
<p class="i2">I'll hear it evermore&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">That song! That song!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Now came the great dramatic effect. On to the stage climbed, in the
latest revue manner, from all parts of the house, the army of which I
had the honour to be one, all pointing the finger of doom at the
cringing Tommy Thurlow. Having got him well into our midst and broken to
the world, we sang at him these stirring lines to a too familiar tune:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">It's a long way to get to Paree,</p>
<p class="i2">It's a long way to go;</p>
<p class="i0">It's the wrong way through little Belgium,</p>
<p class="i2">The wrongest way we know.</p>
<p class="i0">Good-bye, <span class="sc">Kaiser Billy</span>;</p>
<p class="i2">Farewell, O mein Herr;</p>
<p class="i0">It's a long, long way to St. Helena,</p>
<p class="i2">But your home's right there!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Terrific success; and, after some moments of reluctance, Aunt Louisa,
still knitting a sock, was induced to bow.</p>

<p>But it wasn't a bad first effort at drama by an old lady in gold
spectacles, was it? I have seen worse by professional writers.</p>

<h2>THE LAST LINE.</h2>

<center>IV.</center>

<p>We progress. The days when the whole art of war consisted of "On the
left, form platoons.... On the <i>left,</i> blanket," are over. Skirmishing,
signalling, musketry, Swedish drill&mdash;a variety of entertainment is now
open to us; there is even a class for buglers. To give you an idea of
the Corps at work, I offer you a picture of James and myself semaphoring
to each other.</p>

<p>James is in the middle distance, a couple of flags draped over his
person. I am going to send him a message. I signal to him that I am
about to begin; he waves back that he is ready. Now then....</p>

<p>My mind becomes a complete blank. I find that I have absolutely nothing
to say to James.</p>

<p>"Go on," says my instructor.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what?" I ask. All desire to interchange thought with James has
left me.</p>

<p>"Anything. Ask him, if a herring and a half costs three ha'pence, how
much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but that's too long. It would take me at least a week, and by that
time the herring would be censored. No, I've got it."</p>

<p>It has occurred to me suddenly that it would annoy James if I reminded
him of his professional life. He looks so military in his puttees and
khaki shirt.</p>

<p><i>"Do&mdash;you&mdash;want&mdash;a&mdash;nice&mdash;mortgage?"</i> I signal.</p>

<p>James takes it up to "nice," and then breaks down. The "m-o" he reads as
"s-w" (an easy mistake to make), and he imagines that I am offering him
a nice sword&mdash;a fitting offer to one of his martial appearance. When the
third letter turns out to be not the "o" which he expected, he loses his
head and signals "Repeat."</p>

<p>I give it him again slowly. He reads the first five letters as s-w-r-t-g
and assumes this time that I am offering him a nice town in Poland. It
is five minutes before we get the mortgage properly established, and by
then James is utterly disgusted.</p>

<p>He is now going to send a message to me. There is nothing half-hearted
about James when he has his khaki shirt on.</p>

<p><i>"Why the devil don't you send up those guns?"</i> he signals.</p>

<p>General James is hard pressed. The enemy is advancing in echelon against
his left wing; cavalry beat themselves against the hollow square on his
right; his centre has formed platoon after platoon unavailingly. Still
the enemy comes on. Where the devil are those guns?</p>

<p>I signalled back:</p>

<p><i>"Sorry, but B Company is using the bullet."</i></p>

<p>It was a blow to James. Reluctantly he came to his decision.</p>

<p><i>"Must fall back,"</i> he said, and he caught a flag between his legs and
did so....</p>

<p>Well, there you have us signalling. To show you us skirmishing I cannot
do better than describe the fierce engagement between A and C Companies,
which resulted in the entire annihilation of A. But perhaps that would
not be fair. I am a prejudiced recorder; let one of A Company speak.</p>

<p>He was annoyed.</p>

<p>"We worked round their flank," he said, "and we'd got quite close up to
them under cover of a wood when we came on one of them smoking a pipe.
He said he was an outpost, and that he'd decimated us all long ago."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"We scragged him."</p>

<p>Personally I had a safer position among the supports. A decimated enemy
in the first flush of annoyance can be dangerous. I merely lay in a
ditch and counted ants.... But I was very glad to hear we'd won.</p>

<p>Rifle exercises go on apace. We have a curious collection of weapons
("weapons of precision" as they are called by those who have never seen
my targets), an order for six hundred of one family having fallen
through, owing to a clerical error. "We can offer you 600 rifles, 1900
pattern," the firm wrote; but an inspection of them showed that the "6"
and the "9" had got mixed up.</p>

<p>But even with more modern weapons than these we are not very formidable
as yet, and for some weeks we must rely on other methods of striking
terror into the hearts of the enemy. Luckily we are acquiring an
excellent substitute for lead. As an example of "frightfulness" nothing
can exceed the appearance of one of our really mixed platoons lying on
its backs and waving its legs in the air. This is one of the Swedish
drill movements ... and, as I think I have mentioned before, we are all
ages and shapes....</p>

<p>Let me conclude with a little story to show the dangers to which we are
subject and the fearlessness with which we face them. I cite the case of
Reginald Arbuthnot Wilkins.</p>

<p>R. A. Wilkins is just as keen as they make them, and it is his great
sorrow that, being in an important Government office, he is not allowed
to enlist. For my liking he is too smart; when he does a "right-turn" he
does it with a jerk that you can almost hear. The click of the heels is
all very well, but Reginald Arbuthnot makes his neck click too. An
"eyes-right" nearly takes his head off.</p>

<p>A dozen of them, including Reginald, were being taught saluting the
other day. There was an imaginary Field-Marshal or somebody on the left,
and they were told to turn the head smartly to the left, at the same
time bringing the right hand up to the salute.... "Sa-<i>lute!</i>" Reginald
Arbuthnot Wilkins whizzed his head round to the left, but accidentally
brought the wrong hand up. There was a crash as his left thumb met his
left eye-ball, and Reginald was in hospital for a week.</p>

<p>The remarkable thing is that the other eleven, quite undismayed, went on
practising the salute. That gives you some idea of our spirit.</p>

<h2>SAFEGUARDS.</h2>

<p>It was the special terms to Special Constables that tempted me&mdash;and I
fell.</p>

<p>I don't just remember how many times I fell, but it was pretty nearly as
often as the "Professor" of the wily art took hold of me. Before the
first lesson was over, falling became more than a mere pastime with me,
it grew into a serious occupation.</p>

<p>So I left the jiu-jitsu school at the end of the second lesson with a
nodding acquaintance with some very pretty holds and a very firm
determination to practise them on Alfred when he got back to the office
next day from Birmingham.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I suppose I ought to have persevered with my lessons a little longer,
but I was losing my self-respect, and felt that nothing would help me to
gain it better than to cause somebody else to do the falling for a bit.</p>

<p>Alfred is six-foot-two, but a trifle weedy-looking, and so good-tempered
that I knew he wouldn't resent being practised on.</p>

<p>As he came in I advanced with outstretched hand to meet him.</p>

<p>"How goes it?" he said cheerily, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Like this," I said, as I gripped his right wrist instead of his
fingers, turned to the left till I was abreast of him, inserted my left
arm under his right, gripped the lapel of his coat with my left hand and
turning his wrist downward with my right, pressed his arm back. To
attack unexpectedly is the great thing.</p>

<p>"Don't be a funny ass," said Alfred, as I lifted myself out of the
waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>How I got there I wasn't quite sure, but concluded that I had muffed the
business with my left arm by not inserting it well above his elbow for
the leverage.</p>

<p>"Sorry," I said; "the new handshake. Everybody's doing it."</p>

<p>"Are they?" said Alfred. "Well, I've been having some lessons in
etiquette myself the last few days from a naval man I met down at Hythe.
Seen the new embrace?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;no," I said, putting a chair between us, "I don't think I have; but
I'm not feeling affectionate this morning. I'm going to lunch."</p>

<p>Thank goodness, if I do meet a spy, I've got a truncheon and a whistle.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>(<span class="sc">Extracted From the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, Wednesday, 11th November.</i>&mdash;Both Houses met for what
will be last Session of ever-memorable Parliament. Usual ceremony at
State Opening by <span class="sc">King</span>, but atmosphere distinctly different from that
familiar on such occasions. No crowd talking and gesticulating in Lobby
before <span class="sc">Speaker</span> takes the Chair. That done, Benches seemed strangely
empty. In Commons, as in Lords, most men wore mourning, the gloom a
little lightened here and there by khaki uniform. Whilst <span class="sc">Leader of
Opposition</span> and <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> spoke Members sat silently attentive. Only
now and then subdued cheer indicated approval of a statement or a
sentiment. There was sign neither of depression nor elation. The
country, fitly represented within these four walls, has undertaken a
great task, its performance making heavy demand of blood and money. At
whatever cost mean to see it through. Meanwhile are grimly silent.</p>

<p>In course of brief proceedings curious instance forthcoming of
prevalence of martial spirit even in unexpected quarters. Did not
witness it myself, being at the moment engaged in showing a constituent
the House of Lords at historic moment when, in absence of <span class="sc">Leader of
Conservative Party, George Curzon</span> rose temporarily to assume functions
he will surely inherit. Story told me by the <span class="sc">Member for Sark</span>, whom I
find a (more or less) trustworthy recorder.</p>

<p>Seems that two new Members were in attendance prepared to take oath and
their seat. In accordance with custom they were ranged at the Bar
awaiting <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> summons. Observing one of them between his
introducers, <span class="sc">Speaker</span> stiffly drew himself up to full height, and called
out in ringing tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ten-<i>shun</i>! Form <i>Fours</i>!"</p>

<p>House stared in amazement. Nothing disconcerts Mr. <span class="sc">Lowther</span>. Recognizing
slip, he quietly ignored it; made fresh start.</p>

<p>"Order! Order! Members desiring to take their seats will please come to
the Table."</p>

<p>Thereupon <span class="sc">President of Board of Agriculture</span>, assisted by Mr. <span class="sc">Burt</span>, the
revered Father of the House, affably conducted towards the Table his
parent, Sir <span class="sc">Walter Runciman</span>, newly elected Member for Hartlepool. Having
seen him duly sign roll of Parliament he stood him tea on the Terrace,
made him free of the smoking-room, and invited him to partake to-morrow
night of famous House shilling dinner.</p>

<p>These filial amenities pleasantly vary the austerity of Parliamentary
life.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Parliament reassembled. Address in reply to Speech
from the Throne moved in both Houses.</p>

almanack counts, actually as young as ever, the Pilot is picked up
again. His appearance at the helm greeted with hearty cheer resounding
from shore to shore.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>

<p>Everyone knows that present condition of Navy, making it dominant on all
seas, is mainly due to him. Recognized as fitting thing that he should
be placed in charge of weapon that with patient endeavour, supreme
skill, unerring foresight he had forged. Never yet in time of war have
these Islands been in such safe keeping. With K. K. at the War Office
and <span class="sc">Jack Fisher</span> at the Admiralty British householder may sleep in his
bed o' nights unafraid.</p>

<p>By another happy concatenation of circumstance Admiralty is represented
in both Houses. With <span class="sc">Winsome Winston</span> in the Commons and <span class="sc">Jack Fisher</span> in
the Lords, the Navy will have a good show. Only doubt is whether <span class="sc">First
Sea Lord</span> will think it worth while to devote to Parliamentary duties the
measure of time exacted from <span class="sc">First Lord of Admiralty</span>. Essentially a man
of action, he has little patience with custom of talking round a matter.
Nevertheless well to know that, if occasion serve, he can make a speech
far beyond average in respect of power and originality. Discovery made
when, six or seven years ago, he fluttered the decorous dovecotes of the
Royal Academy by delivering at its annual banquet a memorable speech on
condition and prospects of Navy.</p>

<p>Unlikely, too, that <span class="sc">Jack Fisher</span> will take part in perfunctory
performances, as when the House, meeting at 4.15, sits twiddling its
noble thumbs till 4.30, the hour on stroke of which public business
commences. There being none, or not any that occupies more than five
minutes, they straight-way adjourn. But, if serious debate on Naval
affairs arises, <span class="sc">First Sea Lord</span> may be counted upon to be at his post.</p>

<p><i>Business done</i>:&mdash;Address agreed to. House adjourned till Monday.</p>

<h2>A TRAGIC MISTAKE AT POTSDAM.</h2>

<center>(<i>In the manner of the Spy Books.</i>)</center>

<p>At about half-past ten this morning I took my little black bag and
walked to the Palace. Presenting my pass, I was about to enter by the
side door reserved for civilians when I felt a heavy blow on my shoulder
and, turning, beheld an officer. Forbidding me to apologise he led me
into the palace by another door, and, placing me in a small room and
enjoining strict silence upon me, he left me alone. This was so
different from the procedure adopted on former occasions that I took
stock of my surroundings. The room was obviously a waiting-room,
containing as it did a pianola, a gramophone and a photograph album of
German generals. I was aroused from my slumbers about two and a-half
hours later and beheld before me an elderly bespectacled officer. I knew
him at once from the picture postcards as Bluteisen, head of the secret
service. He examined me minutely, omitting, however, to look into my
little black bag, which clearly escaped his notice. I began to explain,
but he ordered silence and beckoned me to follow. He led me up three
flights of stairs, along a corridor, down four flights, and so on for
about three-quarters of an hour, his idea, I suppose, being completely
to mystify me. At length we arrived at a door deep under-ground, upon
which Bluteisen knocked mysteriously. Receiving no answer he turned to
me and said, "Push." I leaned hard upon the door, fell suddenly forward
and stepped briskly into the room.</p>

<p>We were in total darkness save for a circle of green light at the
further end of the apartment. In this circle was a desk, at which was
seated a man writing. One glance at him and I trembled with excitement.
<i>I was in the Presence.</i></p>

<p>For fully thirty minutes he kept me standing. Nothing was heard but an
occasional graunch, graunch, as he devoured the end of his pen. At last
he spoke. "Number?" he said.</p>

<p>I was about to stammer an explanation, but Bluteisen cut me short with a
warning look, saluted and said, "Three nine double nine."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" the Personage asked.</p>

<p>"About three hours," I replied.</p>

<p>He seemed pleased. Then he gave me a paper. "Read that," he said.</p>

<p>I read it. My hair, usually complacent, rose with fear and astonishment.
What I read was this:&mdash;"You will blow up the British Albert Memorial at
your earliest convenience. Telegraph when completed, if still alive."</p>

<p>"Have you got it?" he asked. I could only nod. He then held the paper in
the flame of a candle till he scorched his finger and thumb.</p>

<p>"You will never see that again," he said. And I never did. Then he
thrust his face at me. "You will succeed?" he snapped. "Sire," I
ventured, my head swimming with apprehension, "I&mdash;I humbly apologise,
but I&mdash;I have never yet blown up anything."</p>

<p>"What!" he shrieked, giving to his moustaches an upward direction,
"what! you are Number three nine double nine, from the Ammunition
section, are you not?"</p>

<p>"No, Sire," I replied, "I'm sorry, but I'm not in any section at all."</p>

<p>There was a terrible silence. With one eye he annihilated me, with the
other he detained Bluteisen, who was sneaking off into the darkness.
Then in a fury he hissed, "What are you? What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>With choking voice I blurted out the simple truth. "Sire," I said, "I
have the honour to inform you that I am here to tune the Imperial
piano."</p>

<p>I understand that I am to be shot at dawn to-morrow. So, thank heaven,
is Bluteisen.</p>

<h2>THE DOCTHOR'S WAR SPEECH.</h2>

<p>Martin Cassidy told it to me. He was there, and he saw the boys form
fours when they marched to the station the next day. There were
seventeen of them, and he said he'd never forget it.</p>

<p>"'Twas the Docthor's war speech that did ut," said Martin. "He had thim
all in Micky's shebeen&mdash;sure they'd have been there annyhow&mdash;and the
Docthor had volunteeerd himself; why not?</p>

<p>"Yes, the women and childer were admitted. Wouldn't they be wantin' to
know the way of it? Av coorse.</p>

<p>"You'd not keep them out annyway. 'Tis the whole of Ballymurky that was
there that night.</p>

<p>"'Twas an o-ration the Docthor gave thim. Ye could have heard a pin
drop. Isn't it mesilf that would be away there now, if they'd let me?
Didn't Patsy Doolan have to sit on me head to keep me from gettin' into
the thrain with thim?</p>

<p>"'Sure the <span class="sc">King</span> knows ye've been drawin' the ould-age pension this two
years,' sez he. 'Won't he have it down in his note-book?' sez he; 'and
you wanten to pass for thirty. Gwan,' sez he."</p>

<p>Old Martin applied a piece of glowing turf to his pipe and sucked
audibly before continuing.</p>

<p>"Don't I remimber ivery wurrd the Docthor shpoke," said Martin
slowly&mdash;"och, the way he had with him.</p>

<p>"'The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> is it?' sez he. 'What would ye be askin' for betther?' sez
he. ''Tis this way and that way wid the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>,' sez he, 'and he'll not
be aisy till he's wiped Ballymurky off the map, so he would. And the
<span class="sc">German Emperor</span> is as bad,' sez he. 'It's Bairrlin or Ballymurky, boys,
so it is,' sez he; 'just that.</p>

<p>"'Is ut have the Germans over here in Ballymurky ye would?' sez he.
'Sure 'tis not butthermilk and praties they'd be contint with, Doolan,
me boy,' sez he; 'faith 'tis your pig they'd be afther atin. And 'tis
not you the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> would be decoratin' with an iron cross; 'tis more
like a lick of his shtick ye'd be afther gettin, Doolan&mdash;and the
thrubble ye've taken with the rarin' of the crayther. Och, ye could
nivver look the pig in the face again if ye shtayed.'"</p>

<p>Martin subsided a while to show me Doolan's pig, which was taking the
air outside. "And that," he remarked, "is corrosive ividence of what I'm
tellin' ye." The pig grunted his compliments, and Martin continued.</p>

<p>"'Wait till I tell ye what they did at Louvain,' sez the Doc. 'Whist
now, till ye hear this,' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Och, 'twas black murther they did there, the villians! The currse of
<span class="sc">Crummle</span> seize thim,' sez he. 'Arrah! hould yoursilf in, you there,
Conlan,' sez he; 'go aisy, now,' sez he; 'sure they'll do worse here.
'Tis not satisfied with Louvain they'll be, Shamus; 'tis knockin' your
cabin about your ears ye'll have them&mdash;and what will hersilf say to
that?' sez he; 'sure, 'twill be the best vintilated cabin in Ireland, so
it will.'</p>

<p>"'Is ut the <span class="sc">German Emperor</span> ye would have sittin' shmokin' his pipe in
your cabin and fryin' sausages in your best pan, without so much as by
your lave, and you waitin' on him, Mrs. Murphy?'</p>

<p>"'Sure, ye know it is not, Docthor dear,' sez she.</p>

<p>"'Drivin up and down the street in your side-car he'd be, Patsy Burrke,
him and his ginerals, till your horse dropped dead on him, and divil a
bit he'd care.</p>

<p>"'I'm lookin' at you there, Larry,' sez the Docthor. ''Tis waitin' for
Molly to say the wurrd ye are, Larry, me boy: but sure 'tis yourself
that'll say the wurrd now. Och, 'tis fallin' over herself Molly will be
to see ye in your rigimintals.</p>

<p>"'Ballymurky, is ut? Arrah ye'll not know Ballymurky afther the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>
has done with it. Isn't it changing the name of the dear ould place that
he'll be afther?</p>

<p>"'First-class he'd be thravellin', no less, with the boots of him on the
sate, and him without a ticket; and 'tis Rothenberg would be the name on
the station, bad cess to him!</p>

<p>"'Rothenberg! d'ye hear that, Casey? And you a railway porther. Isn't
<span class="sc">Kitchener</span> an Irishman, good luck to him, and isn't he lookin' for ye all
to go? Isn't the <span class="sc">Tsar</span> of Russia himself goin' to Berlin, and won't he be
lookin' for ye there, Micky? What'll he think if ye are not there to
meet him? "So Micky didn't come," he'll say; "what's come over him?"
he'll say. "Sure he's not the boy I thought he was," he'll say. Just
that. And you there, Micky, ye divil, all the time. Ye'd have the laugh
on him thin, Micky, so ye would.</p>

<p>"'"Begorra!" he'll say, looking round, "sure the whole of Ballymurky's
here." And why not? Bedad 'tis not the first time that Ballymurky's been
on the spree.</p>

<p>"'The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> is ut, boys,' sez the Docthor. 'Arrah have done with ye,'
sez he. 'Sure there won't be anny <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> worth mintioning afther
Ballymurky's finished wid him...."</p>

<p>"Be this and be that I'm thinkin' the same too," said Old Martin
Cassidy, as he relighted his pipe.</p>

<h2>THE OLD BULLDOG BREED.</h2>

<center><i>The Wavecrest Hydro, Hastings.</i></center>
<center><i>To the Editor of "Punch."</i></center>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I have on several previous occasions communicated to you some
instructive and illuminating examples of the extraordinary intelligence
of my dog Boanerges, but so far (doubtless owing to extreme pressure on
your space) you have not been able to publish them.</p>

<p>In view of the present grave national emergency, however, I feel
confident that you will be able to find space for the latest instance.</p>

<p>Boanerges is of the old bulldog breed; that is to say, he is not
precisely a bulldog, but inherits the breed from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
of his grandfathers. Superficially he presents more the appearance of a
wire-haired retriever pom, and it has been difficult to classify him at
Dog Shows. Indeed, I have claimed for him (though unsuccessfully up to
the present) a new class, viz., Pom-Poms. <i>The Canine Chronicle</i> lent me
the weight of its editorial support, suggesting as an alternative name:
Dum-Dums, or Soft-Nosed Bullettes, but I fear me it was scarcely
dignified enough to carry weight with the authorities.</p>

<p>However, all that is by the way. His heart is in the right place. No
<span class="sc">Wilhelm</span> shall land upon Hastings soil while Boanerges guards the beach.</p>

<p>To resume, it is my custom to take Boanerges with me on my weekly visit
to a local picture palace. He enjoys it; it stimulates his already keen
intelligence; and there is no charge made for dogs. He stands on my
knees with his fore-paws on the stall in front, and follows the films
with rapt attention. Occasionally he will express his approval or
disapproval by barking, but always in a thoroughly gentlemanly way. He
is critical, but not captious; laudatory, but not fulsome. He makes
allowances for the limitations of the camera. He usually cheers at what,
I believe, are technically known as "the chases," and his hearty bark of
approval is welcomed by the manager of the theatre and by the regular
patrons. Indeed, I firmly believe that Boanerges attracts extra
patronage to the Thursday matin&eacute;es. He also enjoys lions and tigers, but
not crocodiles or snakes. As I have said, he is of the old bulldog
breed.</p>

<p>On Thursday last I took Boanerges with me as usual. It was a dull
programme at first, being chiefly devoted to imaginative drama in a Red
Indian reservation. Boanerges growled the old bulldog growl once or
twice, and I could see that he was disappointed with the performance.</p>

<p>Then came the film of topical events. A heading appeared on the screen:
"The Germans in Louvain." I could feel Boanerges stiffen all over his
wiry bristles.</p>

<p>The stark ruins were shown, with Prussian soldiers on arrogant
sentry-go. Somebody, no doubt a refugee, hissed out: "<i>A bas les
Bosches!</i>" Boanerges growled a deep menace.</p>

<p>Then came a picture of the main square of Louvain, with a group of
generals waiting for the march-past and the salute. The soldiers marched
towards us, victorious and triumphant, <i>at the goose-step</i>.</p>

<p>That was the breaking-point. Flesh and blood could stand it no longer.
All the bulldog strain pounded in his veins. With a roar of anger such
as I have never before heard from him, Boanerges leapt from my
restraining hands and made for the picture.</p>

<p>He dashed straight at the screen and through it! He devoured a whole
company of goose-stepping Prussians at, so to speak, one mouthful.</p>

<p>I also, unwontedly moved, rose in my seat and shouted, "Up and at 'em!"</p>

<p>Boanerges hit the boarding behind the screen, and I think that his nose,
now in bandages, is permanently damaged. Still, his brave deed echoes
through Hastings, and recruiting in the town is brisker than it has ever
been before.</p>

<p>This time, Sir, I feel confident that you will not refuse Boanerges his
well-deserved place in your columns.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours, etc.,</p>

<h2>UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.</h2>

<center>No. VIII.</center><br />

<center>(<i>From Richard Dickson, generally known as Cock-eyed Dick, Private in
the South Loamshire Light Infantry.</i>)</center>

<p>I suppose I ought to beg your Majesty's humble pardon for using a pencil
for this letter, but it's a good pencil, and, anyhow, we don't run to
ink in the trenches. I don't want to be disrespectful to your Majesty's
Highness. Fact is I'm just a bit fond of you; you're doing our chaps
such a world of good, keeping our hearts up in a manner of speaking and
making us all so angry. When your regiments come out against us, the
word goes round, and it's "Steady, boys; remember we're a contemptible
little army; let's show 'em a bit of contemptible shooting at 800
yards," or "Fix your contemptible bayonets and go for 'em;" and I
warrant there's many a German chap out of the fighting line for good and
all just on account of that nasty word.</p>

<p>There's another word, too, that some of your chaps have slung at us.
They say we're a "mercenary" lot, meaning that we took up with
soldiering just because we're paid to do it. Well, we <i>are</i> paid a
shilling or two now and then, but don't you go and make no mistake; we
don't stick it out in the trenches, with Black Marias playing bowls with
us, and the machine-guns crackling at us and the snipers picking us off
just because of getting a few shillings, which very often we don't get
regular. We're in for this job, ah, and we're going to see it through,
too, because we think it's the right thing to do and because we wanted
to do a turn of fighting. We ain't bloodthirsty, and I'm not going to
say we shall be miserable when it's all over, but while it's going on we
like it. There's risks everywhere, even with the quietest jobs. I knew a
chap once as drove a goat-cart for children at the seaside, and one day
when the wind was strong it blew off his hat, and he got to chasing it,
and before he knew where he was he'd gone over the cliff. A careful man
he was, too, but he hadn't reckoned up that particular chance when he
put his savings into a goat and a two-wheeled cart. You can't think of
everything, even if you happen to be a Kaiser. I've heard, by the way,
that you ain't paid so badly for <i>your</i> job of Kaisering; and old Uncle
Franky over in Austria, he rakes 'em in, too, but we don't call you a
mercenary pair, though what drove you to take up the business is more
than I can make out.</p>

<p>I don't want you to go and make no mistake. You've stirred us up a bit
with all your talk, but we've got no grudge against your soldiers. We
don't <i>hate</i> 'em. They're good fighting men, though I'm not saying that
we ain't better, and good fighting men don't hate one another. We got
one of your blokes the other day. He came on with the attack, and when
we'd beaten it off, there he was still coming on. He'd dropped his rifle
and his helmet was off, and he was groping about with his hands, and he
wasn't shouting "Hock! Hock!" but he didn't stop. We didn't loose off at
him, there was something so funny about him, and in another minute he
tumbled in right atop of us and we took him. He told us afterwards he'd
lost his spectacles and couldn't see a yard in front of him, and that
was the reason for his being so brave. He talked English, too, but in a
funny way, slow and particular and like as if he'd got a bit of suet
pudding in his mouth. Well, we soon made him snug and tidy and then we
started to pull his leg and fill him up, and he swallowed it all down.
We told him something had gone wrong with the beefsteak pie and the jam
tartlets and the orange jelly, and he'd have to satisfy himself with his
own rations; but to-morrow there'd be a prime cut of mutton and an
apple-tart; and he believed all our fairy tales and said he'd write the
story of the English army's food if ever he got home alive. He was a
learned man too, but his lost spectacles gave him a lot of trouble. The
end of it was we made quite a pet of him, and we were quite sorry when
we got relieved and took him to the rear and handed him over as a
prisoner. There wasn't any hatred about it.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</center>

<p><i>Sinister Street, Vol. II.</i> (<span class="sc">Secker</span>) is a book for which I have been
waiting impatiently this great while, and I welcomed it with eagerness.
The first volume left off, you may remember, with <i>Michael</i> just about
to go up to Oxford. Knowing what Mr. <span class="sc">Compton Mackenzie</span> could do with
such a theme, I have anticipated all these months that to watch his hero
at the university would be to renew my own youth. The book has appeared
now, and I am justified of my faith. I say without hesitation that the
first half of this second volume (which, by the way, to show that it is
a second volume and not a sequel, starts at page 499) is the most
complete and truest picture of modern Oxford that has been or is likely
to be written. For those who, like myself, have their most cherished
memories bound up with the life of which it treats, the actuality of the
whole thing would make criticism impossible. But as a matter of fact
these seventeen chapters seem to me to show Mr. <span class="sc">Mackenzie's</span> art at its
best. They display just that strange combination of realism and
aloofness that gives to his writing its special charm. No one has ever
(for example) reproduced more perfectly the talk of young men; and this
scattered speech, in what Mr. <span class="sc">Mackenzie</span> himself might call its
infinitely fugacious quality, contrasts effectively with the deliberate,
somewhat mannered beauty of the setting. Mr. <span class="sc">Mackenzie</span> is an overlord of
words, old and new, bending them to strange and unexpected uses, yet
always avoiding affectation by the sheer vitality of his strength. As
for the matter of these first chapters, one might say that nothing
whatever happens in them. They are an epic of adolescence wherein growth
is the only movement. Events are for the second half of the volume. Here
<i>Michael</i> has come down from Oxford, and has set himself to find and
rescue by marriage the girl <i>Lily</i>, whom (you remember) he loved as a
boy, and who has since drifted into the underworld. About this part of
the story I will only say that, though the art is still there and the
same haunting melody of style, Mr. <span class="sc">Mackenzie</span> has too strong a sense of
atmosphere to allow him to treat squalor in a fashion that will be
agreeable to the universe. Frankly, the over-nice will be prudent to
take leave of <i>Michael</i> on the Oxford platform. The others, following to
the end, will agree with me that he has placed his creator definitely at
the head of the younger school of English fiction.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>For me, the pleasure of travelling consists less in the sight of
museums, cathedrals, picture galleries and landscapes, than in the study
of the native man in the street and his peculiar ways. When abroad, "I
am content to note my little facts," and so is Mr. <span class="sc">Geo. A. Birmingham</span>;
in fact, it was he who first thought of mentioning the matter. The
reverend canon tours in the U.S.A., which is, when you come to think of
it, about the only safe area for the purpose nowadays; he observes the
manners and oddities of the Americans, whether as politicians, pressmen,
hustlers, holiday-makers, hosts, undergraduates, husbands or wives, and
remarks upon them, in <i>Connaught to Chicago</i> (<span class="sc">Nisbet</span>), with just that
quiet and unboisterous humour which his public has come to demand of him
as of right. His first chapter shows that he has ever in mind the
multitude of his fellow-countrymen who have, in the past, made the same
journey but for good and all. This memory leads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span> him at times into
excessive praise of his subjects, especially the ladies, and so to
apparent disparagement of his people at home. For my part I vastly
prefer the Irish, men, women and children, in Ireland to all or any of
their relatives and friends elsewhere; for when they leave their island
their humour runs to seed and loses that detachment and delicacy which
constitute its unique charm. That Mr. <span class="sc">Birmingham</span>, however, was not
nearly long enough abroad to suffer this deterioration, must be patent
to all who linger over this happy book.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>If Miss <span class="sc">Jessie Pope</span> receives her just reward, she will soon have to put
a notice in the daily papers to the effect that she is grateful for kind
enquiries, but is unable at present to answer them. For I think that any
enterprising boy who reads <i>The Shy Age</i> (<span class="sc">Grant Richards</span>) will forthwith
make it his business to find out the name of the school at which <i>Jack
Venables</i> amused himself, and that even if unavoidable circumstances
prevent him from going there he will, at any rate, remain disgruntled
until he can place his finger upon it on the map. After reading those
tales of school and holiday life, I can only say that the school which
harboured me must have been a dull place, and that I should now like to
return there for a term at least&mdash;I doubt if I should be allowed to stay
longer&mdash;and liven things up. Miss <span class="sc">Pope</span> starts with one great advantage
over men who write of boys' schools, because the critics cannot say that
her work is autobiographical, and then proceed to "recognise" most of
her characters. That is the terror lurking by day and night for any man
who dares to write a school-tale. On the other hand, although Miss <span class="sc">Pope</span>
has fitted herself remarkably well into the skin of <i>Jack Venables</i>, who
tells these stories but is not (thank goodness) the hero of most of
them, she has not been able entirely to avoid what I must call Papal
touches. For instance, I do not believe that a boy of <i>Jack's</i> age and
character would use the word "feasible," and a special society would
have to be started for the prevention of cruelty to any boy who ventured
to talk of his "aunties." On the whole, however, she has a fine
understanding of boy-nature, and if there are some improbabilities in
these ingenious stories, she is armed with the crushing retort that the
chief characteristic of any properly equipped boy is his improbability.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Possibly owing to some personal disinclination towards violent bodily
exertion on the part of his creator, <i>Father Brown</i>, the criminal
investigator of Mr. <span class="sc">G. K. Chesterton's</span> fancy, is not a fellow of
panther-like physique. For him no sudden pouncing on the frayed
carpet-edge, or the broken collar-stud dyed with gore. He carries no
lens and no revolver. Flashes of psychological insight are more to him
than a meticulous examination of the window-sill. When the motive is
instantly transparent, why bother about the murderer's boots? In the
circumstances it is perhaps fortunate for the reverend sleuth that he
nearly always happens to be in either at the death or immediately after
it, instead of being summoned a day or two later when the grotesque
circumstances of the crime have baffled the panting ingenuity of
Scotland Yard. You find him now in this part of England, and now in
that, now in America, and now in Italy. He is, in fact, a hedge-priest
and has not even a cure of souls in Baker Street. But wherever he goes
with his flapping hat and his umbrella he chances on some fantasy of
guilt. Yet any pangs we may feel for the absence of the familiar
setting&mdash;the pale-faced butler in the guarded dining-room of the
country-house and the staggered minions of the local constabulary&mdash;are
assuaged by the brilliant narrative manner in which <i>The Wisdom of
Father Brown</i> (<span class="sc">Cassell</span>) is set forth. Here is the paradoxical world of
Mr. <span class="sc">Chesterton's</span> imagination described in his own verbiage and proved by
actual and grisly events. In that starry dream of a detective story
which I sometimes have, where sleuth-hounds are pattering along the
Milky Way and pursue at last the Great Bear to his den, <i>Father Brown</i>
and <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, the one spectacled, the other lynx-eyed, are
following the prey in leash.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Should you, among wild by-ways of Donegal or Connemara, meet a
procession composed of <i>Patsy McCann</i> the Tinker and the Ass and <i>Mary</i>
with <i>Finaun</i> the Archangel, <i>Caeltia</i> the Seraph, <i>Art</i> the Cherub,
<i>Eileen ni Cooley</i> (a savage lady of easy morals), <i>Billy the Music</i>,
the Seraph Cuchulain and <i>Brien O'Brien</i>, a lost soul who had a
threepenny-bit stolen on him by <i>Cuchulain</i> that same, you would guess
there's only one living man could be behind it&mdash;to wit <span class="sc">James Stephens</span>,
<i>Crock-of-Gold</i> <span class="sc">Stephens</span>. Fantastic things indeed happen in <i>The
Demi-Gods</i> (<span class="sc">Macmillan</span>), which is a kind of inspired nightmare, a sort of
Chestertonian inconsequence done into Gaelic, a little less violent and
with a little less malt, but even less coherent. At the risk of being
reckoned among the egregiously imperceptive I would ask Mr. <span class="sc">Stephens</span>
solemnly whether he is not in danger of letting his fancy take bit
between teeth and land him in some bog of sheer literary chaos. The most
distant of the futurists notwithstanding, there must be some rules to
the game or you don't get your work of art. When those modern wizards of
the halls set themselves to a piece of <i>bizarre</i> juggling, say, with a
string of pearls, a dumb-bell and a rose-petal, they do toss and
catch&mdash;don't merely let everything just drop. Mr. <span class="sc">Stephens</span> will know
what I mean without caring overmuch. There's something in it all the
same. Anyway, there really are in <i>The Demi-Gods</i> delicate shy pearls
and gleams of the authentic gold of the original <i>Crock</i>. And after all
it wasn't written for middle-aged gentlemen of the Saxon tribe.</p>
